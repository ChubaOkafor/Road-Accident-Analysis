## Project Overview
This is an analysis of road accident data in the United Kingdom based on data such as vehicle type, road conditions, longitude, latitude, speed limit etc. The proect aims to get actionable insights regarding road accidents in the United Kingdom for the period under consideration (2021 & 2022)

## Data Sources
Road Accident Data: The main dataset for this analysis is the "road_accident_data.xlsx" file which contains detailed information about road accidents in the United Kingdom in 2021 and 2022

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning and Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
This stage of the product was done using a variety of features in microsoft excel. The actions performed in this stage are as follows;
- Finding and removal of duplicates
- Using the text function in excel to extract the year and month in separate columns from the accident date column
- Removal of columns irrelevant to the analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
This involved exploring the road accident data to generate actionable insights to enable informed decision making. Pivot tables in excel were used to answer questions to gain these insights. The questions this analysis sought to answer are as follows;
- What are the total number of casualties?
- What are the total number of casualties by road type?
- What are the number of causualties by light condition?
- What are the number of casualties by location/area?
- What are the number of casualties by vehicle type?
- What are the number of casualties by road surface?

## Data Visualization
This entailed providing a visual representation to the analysis performed. It was done with the use of a variety of graphs and charts such as line chart, bar chart, donut chart etc. This analysis also made use of slicers and timelines to gain further insights into the road accident data.

## Results/Findings
The findings of this project are summarized below;
- 84% of total casualties were slight casualties, while 14% were serious casualties and 2% were fatal casualties
- Majority of casualties occured on single carriageway road type
- Majority of casualties occured during day time
- Most casualties occured in Urban areas
- Majority of casualties occured in small sized vehicles
- Most casualties occured on dry road surfaces

## Recommendations
The recommendations based on the analysis done are summarized below;
- Review current road networks to identify areas for improvement
- Ensure strict compliance with driving rules and regulations with consequences for non-compliance
- Review current driving regulations and road laws
- Ensure trained traffic and road officials are at strategic locations to oversee the traffic and road activities in those areas
- Create designated lanes and road networks for vehicles within and around a particular weight limit
